Basic running of the code : +100 points 
   for the following 2 cases,code runs  without stopping in both cases (with and without pressing ctrl C)
    ./warmup2 -n 4 -r 7 -B 7 -P 5 -lambda 3.333 -mu 8.5     
    ./warmup2 -mu 0.85 -r 0.5 -P 5 -lambda 33.33 -B 7 -n 4 

   for the following tests, server threads are not idel for the entire run when <Cntrl+C> is not pressed 
    ./warmup2 -B 3 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f0.txt 
    ./warmup2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f1.txt -B 2 
    ./warmup2 -B 1 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f2.txt 
    ./warmup2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f3.txt 
    ./warmup2 -r 5 -B 2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f4.txt 
    ./warmup2 -B 2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f5.txt -r 15 
    ./warmup2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f6.txt -r 25 -B 2 
    ./warmup2 -t ~csci570b/public/cs402/warmup2/f7.txt -B 1 -r 5 


	Missing required section(s) in README file : All sections completed.
	Did not submit binary file
	Cannot compile : Code compiles properly.
	Compiler warnings : There are no warnings.
	"make clean" : make clean works fine.
	Segmentation faults : There were no segmentation faults.
	Program terminates: Program terminates both when <Ctrl +C >is pressed and when it is not pressed.
	Separate compilation : Separate compilation satifies. I have provided my402list.c and warmup2.c. They compile seperately.
	Malformed input : Malformed input messages are printed properly with line numbers and field description.
	Too slow : Program run fast.
	No Delay in tace printing 
	No Busy wait. Have used guard commands . No semaphores. 




Handling of commandline arguments: Handles all command line arguments 
    

Trace output : 
    Each regular packet must have 7 lines of trace and contain
          
    Each dropped packet has exactly 1 line of trace and contain
          
    Each removed packet (due to <Cntrl+C>) contains correct removal
           
    Each token arrival (dropped or not dropped) has  exactly 1 line
           of trace and contain correct information 
    Timestamps are monotonically non-decreasing 

Statistics output : The statistics match the trace
 
Output bad format : No bad output format
Output wrong precision for statistics (should be 6-8 significant digits) : Correct precision for statistics 

Large service time test : simulation works taking service time of 10 seconds since this is deterministic approach
Large inter-arrival time test : simulation works taking inter arrival time of 10 seconds since this is deterministic approach
Tiny inter-arrival time test : simulation works fine
Tiny service time test : simulation works fine

Large total number of customers test : simulation ends on pressing  <Cntrl+C> after 15 seconds
    
Large total number of customers with high arrival rate test : simulation ends waiting for 2 seconds more on pressing  <Cntrl+C> after 15 seconds

Large inter-packet-arrival time <Cntrl+C> test : simulation finishes immediately on pressing <Cntrl+C> immediately after packet 1 has arrived
    
Large inter-token-arrival time <Cntrl+C> test : simulation finishes immediately on  pressing <Cntrl+C> immediately after token 1 has arrived
    
Dropped tokens test : code passes this test 
  

 Packet arrival thread terminates when required.
 No xtra packets are generated after <Cntrl+C> is pressed.

 token thread terminates when required. 
 No extra tokens are generated after all the packets have been created and Q1 became empty or after <Cntrl+C> is pressed

Not using condition variables or do some kind of busy-wait : Used condtion varibales , No busy waits , Used guard commands to handle busy waits 

Synchronization check : Used only mutexes. No semaphores are used.
  
Deadlocks :  No deadlocks in the code.

Bad commandline or command : All the cases in the grading guidelines are handled by the code. Appropriat error mesages are print
